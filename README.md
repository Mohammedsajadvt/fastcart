Project README
Overview
This project is a web application built using modern JavaScript/TypeScript frameworks, likely Vite, given the presence of vite-env.d.ts. The structure is organized to support a scalable and modular development process, with separate directories for components, layouts, pages, styles, and utilities.
Folder Structure
Root Directory

App.tsx: The main React component that serves as the entry point for the application.
main.tsx: The JavaScript/TypeScript file that initializes the application, typically setting up the React DOM.
vite-env.d.ts: TypeScript declaration file for Vite, providing type definitions for Vite-specific APIs.
.gitignore: Specifies which files and directories to ignore in Git.
.eslintrc.config.js: Configuration file for ESLint, used to enforce code quality and style guidelines.
index.html: The main HTML file that serves as the entry point for the web application.
package.json: Defines the project dependencies, scripts, and metadata.
pnpm-lock.yaml: Lock file for pnpm, ensuring consistent dependency installations.

src Directory

app: Contains the core application logic and configuration.
assets: Stores static assets such as images, fonts, and other media files.
components: Houses reusable React components used throughout the application.
features: Contains feature-specific modules or logic, promoting a modular architecture.
layouts: Includes layout components that define the structure of different pages (e.g., headers, footers).
pages: Contains individual page components, each representing a unique view or route in the application.
routes: Manages routing configuration, likely using a framework like React Router.
services: Holds service modules for API calls, data fetching, or other business logic.
css/styles: Contains CSS files for styling the application.
theme: Manages theme-related files, such as color schemes or design tokens.
types: TypeScript type definitions to ensure type safety across the project.
utils: Utility functions and helper modules used throughout the application.

Technologies Used

Vite: A fast build tool and development server for modern web projects.
React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, used with TypeScript.
TypeScript: A superset of JavaScript that adds static types for better scalability.
pnpm: A package manager for installing and managing dependencies.
ESLint: A tool for identifying and fixing problems in JavaScript/TypeScript code.
CSS: Used for styling, managed within the css/styles directory.
MUI (Material-UI): A popular React UI framework for building responsive and customizable interfaces.
Redux: A predictable state management library for managing the application's state.

Purpose
This project is designed to create a robust, maintainable web application with a focus on modularity and scalability. The use of TypeScript (*.ts, *.tsx) ensures type safety, while Vite provides a fast development experience. The organized folder structure separates concerns, making it easier to manage code, styles, assets, and routes. MUI enhances the project with pre-built, customizable components for a polished user interface, and Redux provides a centralized state management solution. This setup is ideal for medium to large-scale applications requiring a clean architecture and reusable components.
Getting Started

Ensure you have Node.js and pnpm installed.
Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.
Run pnpm install to install dependencies.
Start the development server with pnpm run dev.
Open http://localhost:5173 (or the port specified by Vite) in your browser.

Contributing
Feel free to submit issues or pull requests. Ensure your code follows the ESLint configuration and adheres to the project structure.
